  The program `split_file' is used to split large files prior to mailing
  them back to the user.

  Its usage is:

    split_file -s <max-part-size> -f <fname-base> [-n]

  By default an integral number of text lines will be written to each "split
  file".  That is, <max-part-size> bytes, plus how ever may characters it takes
  to commplete the current text line.

  The `-n' option specifies that exactly <max-part-size> bytes will be written
   to each "split file".

  <fname-base> is the base part of the output file name; a `.<n>' will be
  appended to the actual name, where <n> is a number greater than or equal
  to zero.
