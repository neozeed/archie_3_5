FTP
---

*        - Need a program(s) that will find all ftp site on the net.

          Program can get list of sites from the netstat info that
          we have on services.

          For each one it should find if the anonymous ftp site
          is running there... 

          Build a list of unique sites and figure out if they belong
          to the same department  according to the name
          i.e. a.b.c and d.b.c would belong to the same one


          This is a one shot deal .. not production code..

        - Script to send mail to a bunch of ftp administrators...

          Given the list, of above, create a script that can send
          email to all the administrators of the list.

          We will use this to inform that we plan to index them ..
          they may decide to not be indexed in which case the
          return address should go to a mailing list..
