listd

This directory contains the source code for the listd program. This
program is responsible for transferring archie site listings amongst
archie servers. It also provides information to the archie retrieval
subsystem. This is a prototype implementation to test the feasibility of
various systems.

The alogrithm for transfer is quite simple. This program is run in two
modes client or server.

It is invoked (in server mode) without any command line arguments by
inetd on connection with a listd server at another archie host site (the
client). If connections with this particular host is permitted this
client listd then requests the set of sites that is currently being
stored on the server. See the PROTOCOL document for the specification how
this information is actually transmitted. The client listd server may
then request some or all of the sites stored on the server site which it
does not have. The server constructs the site files as they are requested
and transmits them. When the client has signalled the end of requested
files, the server may choose to reverse the process and perform a similar
operation.

In client mode, the listd process is initiated at certain times to itself
contact other archie hosts.

The server may be extended to transmit information for other databases
maintained by archie.
