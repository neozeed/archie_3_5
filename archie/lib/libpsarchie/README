This directory contains code needed to integrate the archie 3 release
with a Prospero server.  

You should start from the most recent prospero release.  You can
obtain information about the release from info-prospero@isi.edu.  The
release should be available on prospero.isi.edu in the file
/pub/prospero/prospero.tar.Z.

Here are specific instructions on how to tie Prospero in to Archie:
Retrieve the release, and untar it.  Installation instructions are
included, but they are not tailored to Archie.  The changes to the
installations instruction for using it with Archie follow:

  1) There is probably no need to set up separate user and group IDs
     for Prospero, just use those for Archie.

  2) In pserver.h, define PSRV_ARCHIE.

  3) In server/Makefile uncomment the appropriate DB_LIBS line
     for your configuration (archie2 or archie3)

  4) In the directory lib/psrv/archie2 or lib/psrv/archie3, create
     a symbolic link archie_src in the directory the archie sources.  Note,
     you must obtain archie sources from the archie group. For archie3,
     these sources must have been obtained after 2/22/93.  For archie2,
     there has been a change to oper.c in the archie sources that should
     have been obtained since 2/22/93.  Note also that for archie2, the
     archie sources must be set up to use the full path of the database
     directory, or you will also have to create a db symbolic link from the
     directory within which the Prospero server will run.

  5) Run make in lib/psrv/archie2 or lib/psrv/archie3 depending
     on your configuration.  If using archie3, make a link from 
     libparchie.a to the file libparchie.a in the archie3 
     distribution.  If you want, you can add lib/psrv/archie2
     or lib/psrv/archie3 to the list of subdirectories in the
     top level Prospero makefile (SUBDIR).

  6) Make the other necessary customizations (as per the installation
     instructions for prospero) by editing include/pserver.h,
     include/pmachine.h, and the top level make file.

  7) As per the installation instructions, do a make, make install,
     then run pstart (you will probably want to add pstart to your
     system startup files).

You may have a version of the archie3 server that expects the Prospero
VLINK structure to have members named 'filename', 'nametype', and
'type'.  If the compilation process fails complaining that such
members were not found, edit the file include/pfs.h and change the line
        #if 0
to read:
        #if 1
and restart the compilation.
