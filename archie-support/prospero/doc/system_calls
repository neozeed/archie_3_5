This is a list of all the system library functions used by the
Prospero server when running in multi-threaded mode.  Each function
has a description of its thread-safe status after it.  This is really
an internal document, but we are providing it in this prerelease for
the sake of anyone wanting to work with the multithreaded distribution.
