Instructions for getting started as a Prospero user

Find the directory in which the Prospero binaries are installed.

Source the file vfsetup.source in this directory.  You may want to
source this file from your .cshrc.

To configure your virtual system, use the vfsetup alias (it is defined
by vfsetup.source).  Specify the name of the virtual system to be
configured as an argument.  If you are just playing around, use the
virtual system: guest.  The command would be "vfsetup guest".

Use vcd and vwd to move around the virtual system, and vls to see what
is there.  These commands will allow you to explore.  Since you may
start from an empty subdirectory, be sure to look above (..), or in
the root directory (/).  A quick summary of the commands that are
available follows.

    vfsetup [-n host path , [-r,v] name , -f file]
      Sets up virtual system
      Example: vfsetup guest

    vcd [-u] path
      Change directory
      Example: vcd /papers/subjects/naming/prospero

    vwd
      Print current virtual working directory
      
    vls [-a, -A, -c, -f, -u, -v] [path]
      List directory
      Example: vls /

    vln [-u] [-s] [-e] [-n host] oldname newname
      Add a link
      Example: vln /papers /guest/articles

    vmkdir directory
      Make a new virtual directory

    vrm link
      Remove a link    

    vget virtual-file [local-file]
      Retrieve a file using anonymous FTP
      Example: vget getting-started.txt these-instructions

To have your own virtual system created, send a message to
pfs-administrator@isi.edu.  With your own virtual system, you will be
able to keep track of the files that you have found.  More details on
the use of Prospero may be found in the Prospero users manual.

The information available through Prospero is growing.  If you can't
find what you are looking for initially, it might appear at a later
date.  You can help by adding information.  Once you have organized
information in your own virtual system, send a message to
pfs-administrator to have it added to the prototype virtual system.
