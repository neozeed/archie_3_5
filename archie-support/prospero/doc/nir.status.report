 1.   Introduction 


 As the network has grown, along with it there has been an increase in
 the number of software tools and applications to navigate the network
 and make use of the many, varied resources which are part of the
 network.  Within the past year and a half we have seen a wide spread
 adoption of tools such as the archie servers, the Wide Area
 Information Servers (WAIS), the Internet gopher, and the Worldwide Web
 (WWW).  In addition to the acceptance of these tools there are also
 diverse efforts to enhance and customise these tools to meet the needs
 of particular network communities.
                
 There are many organisations and associations that have recently begun
 to focus on the proliferating resources and tools for networked
 information retrieval (NIR).  The Networked Information Retrieval
 Group is a cooperative effort of three major players in the field of
 NIR: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Association of
 European Research Networks (RARE), and the Coalition for Networked
 Information (CNI) specifically tasked to collect and disseminate
 information about the tools and to discuss and encourage cooperative
 development of current and future tools.
                
 The purpose of this report is to increase the awareness of NIR by
 bringing together in one place information about the various networked
 information retrieval tools, their developers, interested
 organisations, and other activities that relate to the production,
 dissemination, and support of NIR tools.  The intention is to make
 this a "living document" and to update it at least two to three times
 a year so that it provides a "snapshot" report on activities in this
 area.

 Whilst the NIR tools in this report are being used on a wide variety
 of information sources including files and databases there remains 
 much that is currently not accessible by these means.  On the other
 hand, the majority of the NIR Tools described here are freely
 available to the networked Research and Education community.  Tools
 for accessing specialised datasets are often only available at a cost.

 It should be noted that in many ways networked information retrieval
 is in its infancy compared with traditional information retrieval
 systems.  Thesaurus construction, boolean searching and classification
 control are issues which are under discussion for the popular NIR
 Tools but as yet are not in widespread use.  However it should be said
 that, with the vast amount of effort that is currently going into the
 NIR field, rapid progress is being made.  Since the last report, much
 work has been done on expanding some of the NIR tools to include
 handling of multimedia information services.  Progress has also been
 made in the discussions on classifying and cataloguing electronic
 information resources.


 2.   How the information was collected

 The information contained in this report was collected over the
 network from the contacts for each NIR Tool or Group using two
 templates:

     - the NIR Tool Template, included in Appendix A;
     - the NIR Group Template, included in Appendix B. 

 The contents of these templates were discussed by the NIR WG in Boston
 (July, 1992) and subsequently on the email list.  (See the Section on
 the NIR-WG for details of how to join this mailing list).  The initial
 draft report was discussed at the NIR Working Group in Washington
 (November, 1992).

 The NIR Tool template was used to collect the information necessary to
 identify and track the development of networked information retrieval
 tools.  This template asked for information such as how and where to
 get the software for each NIR Tool, ease of use (from the user's point
 of view), how to make information available using it, documentation,
 demonstration sites, etc.  It was intended that the main part of this
 should have been completed by the main individual responsible for the
 tool.  Sections of the template may have required completion by
 others.

 The NIR Group template requested information on the aim and purpose of
 the group, the current tasks being undertaken, mailing lists, document
 archives, etc.

 NIR Tool Name:      Alex

 Brief Description of Tool:

  OVERVIEW:

  The Alex filesystem provides users and applications transparent read
  access to files in anonymous FTP sites on the Internet.  Today there
  are thousands of anonymous FTP sites with a total of a few millions of
  files and roughly a terabyte of data.  The standard approach to
  accessing these files involves logging in to the remote machine.  This
  means that an application can not access remote files like local
  files.  This also means that users do not have any of their aliases or
  local tools available.  Users who want to use an application on a
  remote file first have to manually make a local copy of the file.
  There is no mechanism for automatically updating this local copy when
  the remote file changes.  The users must keep track of where they get
  their files from and check to see if there are updates, and then fetch
  these.  In this approach many different users at the same site may
  have made copies of the same remote file each using up disk space for
  the same data.

  Alex addresses the problems with the existing approach while remaining
  within the existing FTP protocol so that the large collection of
  currently available files can be used.  To get reasonable performance
  long term file caching is used.  Thus consistency is an issue.
  Traditional solutions to the cache consistency problem do not work in
  the Internet FTP domain: callbacks are not an option as the FTP
  protocol has no provisions for this and polling over the Internet is
  slow.  Therefore, Alex relaxes file cache consistency semantics, on a
  per file basis, and uses special caching algorithms that take into
  account the properties of the files and of the network to allow a
  simple stateless filesystem to scale to the size of the Internet.


  USER'S VIEW:

  To a user or application, Alex is just a normal filesystem.  Any
  command that works on local files will work on Alex files.  Since Alex
  is a real filesystem, nothing needs to be recompiled and no libraries
  are changed.  Thus, users can apply all of their existing skills and
  tools for using files.

  The user sees a filesystem with a hierarchical name space.  At the top
  level (/alex) there are top-level Internet domains like "edu", "com",
  "uk", and "jp".  Each component of the hostname becomes a directory
  name.  Then the remote path is added at the end.  If the user does a
  "ls /alex/edu/berkeley" he sees some machine names such as "ucbvax"
  and "sprite" and some directories on berkeley.edu.  From the "ls" it
  is not clear what is where.  The user may or may not be aware of host
  boundaries.


  INFORMATION PROVIDER'S VIEW:

  Alex is implemented as a user level NFS server.  NFS was chosen
  because it makes it easy to add Alex to a wide range of machines.
  Most machines can simply use the mount command.

  The model of usage is that there is one Alex server running at each
  institution (though this is not required in any way).  Users mount the
  local server which caches files for users at that site.

  Any information put into any anonymous FTP site becomes available via
  Alex.

 ARCHIE    


 Date template updated or checked:       22 March, 1993

 NIR Tool Name:                  archie

 Brief Description of Tool:


  The archie system is a tool for gathering, indexing and serving
  information from around the Internet.  The current version serves a
  collection of filenames found at anonymous FTP sites, as well as a
  smaller collection of text descriptions for software, data and other
  information found at anonymous FTP archives.  Additional databases are
  under development.

  User's View:

  Users run a client program to connect to an archie server and issue
  search commands to find information in an archie database.  In the
  case of an anonymous FTP filename, this information can then be used
  to fetch the file directly from the archive site using the `ftp'
  command.  To the user, archie could be seen as a `secondary source' of
  information which, because of the high cost of locating and serving,
  would not otherwise be available.

  The user searches the archie databases through either a telnet session
  to a machine running an archie server, or by using a stand-alone
  client program (which uses the Prospero protocol for sending and
  receiving requests).  There is also an email interface which allows
  users to send and receive search requests via electronic mail.

  Freely available archie clients exist for most operating systems and
  can be fetched using anonymous FTP from most of the current archie
  servers.  There are also gateways to the archie system from many other
  NIR tools, including Gopher, WAIS and WWW.  An X.500 interface to
  archie is currently under development.

  Information Provider's View:

  There are two types of information providers who would be interested
  in archie.  Primary information providers are interested in having a
  summary of the information provided by their service tracked by an
  archie server.  Secondary service providers, or those sites wishing to
  provide a "value-added" service for the Internet can elect to run an
  archie server at their site to provide a useful service to users, to
  raise the profile of their institution on the Internet, or to provide
  market differentiation (for commercial service providers).

  The archie system is of particular utility serving information where
  there are many sites to be searched and/or where the cost of searching
  each site is high.

  For example, there are currently over 1,200 anonymous FTP sites on the
  Internet, and the number continues to grow.  Searching for a specific
  filename at a single site may involve scanning hundreds, or even
  thousands of filenames.  Thus, most operators of anonymous FTP
  archives welcome the fact that archie indexes and serves the names of
  all files available from each site tracked.

  Information Types Supported:

  The archie system allows the gathering and serving of arbitrary
  information types, although the current system serves only freeform
  text and a dedicated text format for filename listings.  WAIS support
  is provided in the most recent release and it is expected that
  additional collections of information will be maintained and served
  using WAIS tools for access in the near future.

 Protocols:

 What is supported:

  The current archie system clients use the Prospero protocol for
  communication with the search engine on the archie server.  Freely
  available clients are available which include source to perform this
  communication for those wishing to implement additional clients.

  The archie server is capable of building arbitrary databases, using
  arbitrary search and access engines and the current release ships with
  the public domain implementation of WAIS.  We expect future archie
  servers to serve information using this protocol.  The current server
  system assumes the TCP/IP protocol suite is available, and in
  particular the ftp protocol for data gathering.

  The archie system can be accessed through systems operating the
  Gopher, WAIS and WWW (HDDL) protocols.  A gateway from the X.500
  system is under development.

 What it runs over:      

  The Prospero protocol implementation runs over its own implementation
  of a reliable datagram protocol based upon UDP.  Data gathering runs
  over the TCP/IP protocol suite.

 Other NIR tools this interworks with:

  Prospero, Gopher, WAIS, WWW.


 Future plans:

  The archie system became a commercial product in October, 1992,
  marketed by Bunyip Information Systems Inc.  The company plans to
  market additional data gathering modules to allow the server code to
  build additional types of databases.  Work is also underway to
  integrate extensions to WHOIS to allow the building and maintaining
  White Pages (names) directories.  The company is also working on other
  Internet information tools that will work with the archie system.

 Location of more information:

  Additional information on the archie product line is available from the
  anonymous ftp archive on "archie.ans.net"..

 Latest version number:          archie 3.0


 Brief Scope and Characteristics:

  This is the first commercial inmplementation of the archie system,
  replacing a version done as a Masters project at McGill University
  during the period 1990-1992.  It comes with an archie telnet client
  that offers a number of minor improvements over earlier versions.
  Additional releases, with a number of additional improvements, are
  planned in the coming months.

 Approximate number of such servers in use:      Currently about 20 (not all
                                                 are publicly available)

 General comments:

  Most users access archie through a freeware or public domain client
  program.  These are available from most archie servers via anonymous
  FTP.  Additional client functionality has been incorporated into the
  server and will be available once the next version of the Prospero
  protocol is frozen and the features become incorporated into the
  clients in the next few months.  Check out the archie directory on
  "bunyip.com" or the banner message when logging into any of the archie
  telnet clients for more details.

 NIR Tool Name:  Gopher

 Brief Description of Tool:

  The internet Gopher protocol is a client/distributed-server document
  search and retrieval protocol developed at the University of
  Minnesota.  Gopher was originally created as a fast, simple,
  distributed, campus-wide information search and retrieval system, ease
  of use and implementation has made Gopher increasingly popular on the
  Internet.  Since its original release, many folks on the Internet have
  contributed to its growth, submitting patches, servers, clients, and
  linking their local servers into the worldwide network of Gopher
  servers.  Gateways exist to seamlessly access a variety of non-Gopher
  services such as FTP, WAIS, USENET news, Archie, etc. In addition, an
  "archie for gopherspace" called veronica (very easy rodent-oriented 
  net-wide index to computerized archives) has been developed at the 
  University of Nevada. Veronica makes it easy to search for items in 
  gopherspace by title.

  The gopher protocol is often described as "fiercely simple"; it is
  connectionless (stateless), and uses reliable streams.  A client
  connects to a server using TCP, and sends a one-line text "selector
  string".  The server responds by returning the item (a file, a
  directory listing, or a link to some other service) corresponding to
  the selector string and immediately closing the connection.  Items in
  directory listings are returned as a series of lines terminated by
  carriage-return line-feed.  Each item (line) is defined by a
  one-character tag to specify the item type, a display string or
  item-name that the client should display to the user, and a number of
  tab delimited fields to specify the selector string, host domain name
  and port number.  Because of its simple and connectionless nature,
  gopher servers make very minimal demands on their host machines and
  gopher clients are extremely easy to implement.

  The users view the Gopher world as a series of networked hierarchical
  directories much like a familiar filesystem.  However the links define
  a graph rather than a simple rooted tree.  Links in the Gopher graph
  may define services other than simple files or directories; these
  include cso (qi) servers, telnet sessions, links to other gopher
  servers, and links to gateway servers.

  The information provider's simplest view is that files and directories
  below a certain root directory on their machine, are all visible and
  available for retrieval by gopher clients.  More features like long
  names, item types, links, and gateway services are available to the
  more sophisticated information provider.

  Servers and clients run on most popular hardware, including Macs, UNIX
  boxes, PC-DOS boxes.  The Internet Gopher name is copyright (c) 1991-1992 
  by the University of Minnesota.  The Internet Gopher protocol is described 
  in an informational RFC (1436) available at better RFC archives everywhere.   
  The gopher software may be retrieved from numerous Gopher or FTP archive 
  sites, including the University of Minnesota Gopher server, the Info-Mac 
  Archive Gopher server, and by anonymous FTP from boombox.micro.umn.edu and
  sumex-aim.stanford.edu.

 NETFIND

  Date template updated or checked: 13th March, 1993
  By: Name:   Mike Schwartz
      Email address:     schwartz@cs.colorado.edu

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 NIR Tool Name: Netfind

 Brief Description of Tool:

  Given the name of a person on the Internet and a rough description
  of where the person works, Netfind attempts to locate information
  about the person.  People can be specified by first, last, or login
  name.  Their place of work can be described by name and/or the
  city/state/country.

  Netfind provides textual information about people, when it is
  able to locate such information.  It is not a directory in the
  usual sense of the word.  Rather, it searches for people using a
  number of Internet services and heuristics about how to locate
  user information.  Because of the techniques it uses, Netfind
  can locate information about more people than any other Internet
  user directory - over 5 million people in over 9,000 domains
  worldwide when last measured.

  You can use the University of Colorado Netfind server by telnet to
  bruno.cs.colorado.edu: login as "netfind" (with no password).  Help
  screens providing more detailed instructions and technical
  information are available there.  There is currently no way for
  non-Internet users to access Netfind (e.g., using an email
  interface).

      Telephone:
           Declined.  (Note: Netfind is currently a volunteer
                   service.  We do not have staff resources to
                   support any telephone inquiries.)

      Fax:

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Help Line (for major center as well as each client):

  There are an increasing number of Netfind servers being set up at
  various Network Information Centers.  However, since Netfind is
  provided as a volunteer service at this time, there is no help line.

 Sponsoring Organisation / Funding source:
  None.  Netfind was originally a research prototype.  It is offered
  as-is, on an unsupported basis.  From time to time the original
  developers make improvements, but it is not currently funded.

  Netfind server.  This information includes a rather complete set of
  Frequently Asked Questions, as well as user help information and
  pointers to other related information.  The second is a
  pre-publication version of a technical paper about Netfind - available
  by anonymous FTP and e-mail from ftp.cs.colorado.edu in the file
  pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/PostScript/White.Pages.ps.Z (compressed
  PostScript) or in the file
  pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/ASCII/White.Pages.txt.Z (compressed
  ASCII).

  The technical paper is currently somewhat dated, as we have made a
  number of improvements to Netfind since it was published.  We plan to
  write a more up-to-date technical paper about Netfind by Summer 1993.

 NIR Tool Name: Prospero

 Brief Description of Tool:

  The Prospero directory service supports a user centered view of files
  scattered across the Internet.  It can be used to organize references
  to files as if they were on your local system, without the need to
  physically move them.  

  Prospero provides access to existing directories and indices that can
  be used to find files of interest that are available from Internet
  archive sites.  Among the indices available is the archie database.
  We hope to have WAIS indices and Gopher directories online in the near
  future. 

  Prospero also provides a mechanism to make directories and indices
  available to end-users and applications in a format that allows
  information from different sources to integrated into a coherent
  whole.  Prospero supports the authentication of clients and allows
  fine grained authorization of requests to directories and indices.

  Prospero does not interpret the data that it organizes.  It does
  provide mechanisms to retrieve the data, but the display and use of
  the data is up to the users application.  Prospero is intended to serve as
  infrastructure that integrates information from a variety of sources and 
  supports a variety of user applications

  Description:

  This mailing list is for general discussion of
  Prospero, for announcements of new sites that have
  come on board, and for announcements of directories
  that people have created to organize the information
  already accessible.
        
  Archive:  There has not yet been any demand to make the
            archive publicly accessible, but we will do so upon request.

 Protocols:

  What is supported:  
       Prospero directory service requests are formatted
       according to the Prospero protocol.

       Prospero does not have its own file retrieval
       protocol.  Files may be automatically retrieved using
       FTP, NFS, AFS, and GOPHER.

  What it runs over:    
       Directory service requests are layered on top of 
       UDP, with our own (included) reliable message delivery
       layer.

  Other NIR tools this interworks with:
       Archie, Gopher, & Wais.

  Future plans:

       We are working on a gateway to allow prospero clients
       to make directory queries to Gopher and WAIS servers
       which do not speak the Prospero protocol.

       The server allows the maintainer to make directory
       information available about selected portions of the
       server's filesystem, such as anonymously FTPable files. 
       The server also is used to publish information from
       other databases, such as Archie.  The server also
       allows users and maintainers to store their own
       customized organizing views of the namespace.
  

  Approximate number of such servers in use:

       50

 Clients:

  Date completed or updated:  21st October, 1992

       Name: Clifford Neuman and Steven Augart
       Email address: info-prospero@isi.edu
       Telephone: (310) 822-1511

  Client software available from:
   Via anonymous FTP: PROSPERO.ISI.EDU, /pub/prospero/prospero.tar.Z

   Via Prospero: /releases/prospero/prospero.tar.Z, in the
       "#/INET/EDU/ISI/swa" virtual system.                    

  Latest Version number:
       Alpha Version 5.0b.

  Brief Scope and Characteristics:

       This is a command-line client, which uses the same
       syntax to navigate through the Prospero namespace
       that a user uses to navigate through the UNIX
       filesystem. ("cd", "ls", etc.)  
 
  General comments:

       Archie clients also make queries in the Prospero
       namespace, so all Archie clients are Prospero clients
       too.  They are better described in the Archie report.

  Future plans:

       We are developing a client based on the popular Gopher
       menu browser.  This client will allow users to
       remotely customize and update virtual systems.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Demonstration sites :

      A guest virtual system is available on PROSPERO.ISI.EDU.
      However, to use it, you must compile the Prospero
      command-line client on your own machine.  Instructions for
      using it come with the Prospero distribution.

  This is a useful first paper to read.  It gives a good
  overview of Prospero and what it does.  It also describes a bit about
  the Virtual System model, of which Prospero is a prototype
  implementation.  Describes what Prospero does, not how it does it.

  This is a good second paper to read about Prospero.  This one is
  targeted more toward system implementors.  It provides more
  implementation details than the paper on organizing Internet
  resources, but less of the vision of how Prospero can be used together
  with other systems.

  This paper describes the reasons that operating systems need to
  support closure, that is they need to make it clear which name space
  is to be used when resolving names.  While closure is one of the
  important features of Prospero, the concept should be applied in other
  operating systems too.

 VERONICA

 NIR Tool Name:  veronica

 Brief Description of Tool:

  veronica: Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized
  Archives.

  veronica is a service that maintains an index of titles of gopher
  items, and provides keyword searches of those titles.  A veronica
  search originates with a user's request for a search, submitted via a
  gopher client.  The result of a veronica search is a set of
  gopher-type data items, which is returned to the gopher client as a
  gopher-compliant menu, customized by the user's keyword specification.
  The user can access any of the resultant data items by selecting from
  the returned menu.  Items on this menu may be drawn from many gopher
  servers.  These are functional gopher items, immediately accessible
  via the gopher client.  Because veronica is accessed via gopher
  clients, it provides access to all types of data supported by the
  gopher protocol and the client implementation.

  A veronica server typically searches the menus of hundreds of gopher
  servers, perhaps all the gopher servers that are announced to the
  Internet.  Currently ( 3-18-93 ), veronica provides an index to 1126
  gopher servers.

  At present, there are no "veronica clients" per se; veronica is
  accessed through normal gopher clients.  veronica is tightly
  integrated with the gopher protocol.

  The veronica service comprises two functions:  
  1). Harvesting menu data from gopher servers, and preparing it for use;
  2). Offering searches of that database to gopher clients.   
      These two functions are not necessarily provided by the same host
      computer.  

  Notice that these are NOT full-text searches of data at gopher-server
  sites, just as archie does not index the contents of ftp sites, but
  only the names of files at those sites.  veronica indexes the TITLES
  on all levels of the menus, for most gopher sites in the Internet.

  Latest version number:        0.2

  Brief Scope and Characteristics:
        Two modules:    a data-collection module and a data-server module.
                        Data-collector runs on any Unix computer that 
                          does TCP and compiles perl.
                        Server module in two flavors:
                          a.  NeXT-based (NeXTStep 3.0) indexing.
                          b.  WAIS-based indexing runs on any Unix box that 
                                will compile WAIS.
                          Server answers gopher query-type at a not-well-known
                          port.
                                
  Approximate number of such servers in use:  four.

  General comments:       Server architecture is changing rapidly; see

 NIR Tool Name:                  WAIS

 Brief Description of Tool:

  WAIS - The Wide Area Information Servers system - is an electronic
  publishing software set which allows you to search out and retrieve
  multimedia information from databases anywhere in the world.  This
  information can be drawn from data stored on your own desktop, in your
  organization mainframe or in a supercomputer on another continent.
  WAIS software includes user interfaces for most platforms, and server
  software that provides automatic indexing of databases.

  WAIS was developed by Thinking Machines Corporation of Cambridge,
  Massachusetts in collaboration with Apple Computer, Inc., Dow Jones &
  Company, and KPMG Peat Marwick.  With over 100 databases and 5,000
  users worldwide, WAIS is rapidly becoming a standard for information
  distribution within the Internet environment.  Much of the software is
  currently available for free use.

  What does WAIS do?

  WAIS allows multimedia information to be stored anywhere on any
  platform.  Using your interface of choice, WAIS enables you to find
  personal, corporate and public information.  The information is
  accessible regardless of format: text, formatted documents, pictures,
  spreadsheets, graphics, sound, or video.

  WAIS recognizes natural language queries the search and retrieval of
  relevant information is made using your native language.  To date, we
  have used English, French, Italian, and Latin!  The most relevant
  documents, regardless of size, can be sent back to the server in their
  entirety to further refine your search (telling the server, "Find me
  more like this document.") Proven searches can be automatically
  repeated, monitoring and alerting you to new information as it becomes
  available.

  How does WAIS work? 

  WAIS uses a single computer-to-computer protocol (NISO Z39.50).  Each
  WAIS server reads your question and based on its words, searches the
  full text of the database for the most relevant documents, and ranks
  them using automatic word weighting.  Servers need not fully
  understand your query; the retrieval process is based on a search
  method called relevance feedback.  Thinking Machines provides an
  implementation of Z39.50 to help vendors develop interfaces and
  servers.

 NIR Tool Name: Whois

 Brief Description of Tool:

   As currently defined, NICNAME/WHOIS services is a TCP transaction based
   query/response server, running on a few specific central machines, that
   provides netwide directory service to internet users.  Since the WHOIS
   service was defined in 1985, it has evolved into a distributed service.
   The DDN Network Information Center, maintains the central NICNAME
   database and server, providing online look-up of individuals, network
   organizations, DDN nodes, and other information of interest to those
   involved in management of the Internet. In addition, many sites now
   maintain local directory servers with information about individuals,
   departments and services at that specific site. Typically these directory
   servers are network accessible. Because these servers are local, there are
   now wide variations in the type of data stored, access, search schemes, and
   interface.   In general, however, the whois servers provide ascii text
   responses to queries which conform to the RFC 954 specifications.
   A template and instructions for submitting information to the DDN
   directory can be retrieved via anonymous ftp in:

 NIR Tool Name:            World-Wide Web
 
 Brief Description of Tool:
 
  The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext
  to make an easy but powerful global information system.
 
  The project is based on the philosophy that much academic information should
  be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow information sharing within
  internationally dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by

  has spread to other areas and attracted much interest in user support,
  resource discovery and collaborative work areas.
 
  READER VIEW
 
  The WWW world consists of documents, and links.  Indexes are special
  documents which, rather than being read, may be searched. The result of such
  a search is another ("virtual") document containing links to the documents
  found.  A simple protocol (" HTTP ") is used to allow a browser program to
  request a keyword search by a remote information server.
 
  The web contains documents in many formats. Those documents which are
  hypertext,  (real or virtual) contain links to other documents, or places
  within documents. All documents, whether real, virtual or indexes, look
  similar to the reader and are contained within the same addressing scheme.
 
  To follow a link,  a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a number if he
  or she has no mouse). To search and index, a reader gives keywords (or other
  search criteria). These are the only operations  necessary to access the
  entire world of data.
 
  INFORMATION PROVIDER VIEW
 
  The WWW browsers can access many existing data systems via existing
  protocols (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway. In this way, the critical
  mass of data is quickly exceeded, and the increasing use of the system by
  readers and information suppliers encourage each other.
 
  Making a web is as simple as writing a few SGML files which point to your
  existing data. Making it public involves running the FTP or HTTP daemon ,
  and making at least one link into your web from another. In fact,  any file
  available by anonymous FTP can be immediately linked into a web. The very
  small start-up effort is designed to allow small contributions.  At the
  other end of the scale, large information providers may provide an HTTP
  server with full text or keyword indexing. This may allow access to a large
  existing database without changing the way that database is managed. Such
  gateways have already been made into Digital's VMS/Help, Technical Univerity
  of Graz's "Hyper-G", and Thinking Machine's "W.A.I.S." systems.
 
  The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of data format
  between suppliers and reader by allowing negotiation of format between a
  smart browser and a smart server. This should provide a basis for extension
  into multimedia, and allow those who share application standards to make
  full use of them across the web.
 
  This summary does not describe the many exciting possibilities opened up by
  the WWW project, such as efficient document caching. the reduction of
  redundant out-of-date copies, and the use of knowledge daemons. There is
  more information in the online project documentation, including some
  background on hypertext and many technical notes.

 X.500

 Date template updated or checked: 1st June, 1993
 By: Name:  Chris Weider 
     Email address: clw@merit.edu

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 NIR Tool Name: X.500

 Brief Description of Tool:

  X.500 is an international standard designed to provide a distributed
  global directory service. It is primarily used today to provide 'White
  Pages' services, although other types of services which have directory
  components (automated mail aliasing, for example) are beginning to be run
  over X.500. In addition to information about people and organizations,
  the Directory also contains a pilot K-12 Directory, pilot Information
  Resource information, and some other non-White Pages information.
  X.500 contains a number of security features, which are implemented
  on different paradigms in the various servers.

  User's View:

  Users (either human or electronic) run a client program to connect to
  a local X.500 server. Since X.500 is distributed, it appears that the
  entire global X.500 directory is available from the local server.
  From this server connection, the user can add, delete, or modify information
  held by the Directory, or issue powerful search commands to locate
  individuals or other information.

  The first solid version of the X.500 protocol was released in 1988, and has
  been the subject of much research in the past 5 years. Consequently,
  there are a large number of clients, for almost every platform, and a
  healthy number of servers. There are mail interfaces to some parts of
  the X.500 directory, and there is a X.500 to Gopher gateway. An X.500 
  interface to archie is currently under development.

  Information Provider's View:

  X.500 provides a set of mechanisms to allow distributed location of,
  maintenance of, and access to a large set of data. However, current 
  servers force a heirarchical view on the location of the data, so
  it may not be suitable for all applications. Also, the X.500 directory
  is today unable to provide access to information at a rate which
  would allow 'real-time' applications (such as keeping routing information
  in the directory).

  Also, there is a great effort underway to reduce the startup costs 
  of X.500 access by providing a lightweight X.500 access protocol for
  client-server applications. This work is detailed in the internet
  draft 'Lightweight Directory Access Protocol' by Yeong, Howes, and
  Hardcastle-Kille. This protocol is expected to make the cost of entry
  for a service provider much less that it has been.

 Information Types Supported:

  X.500 allows information to be served in an attribute:value paradigm,
  with related attributes grouped into 'objects'. Each entry in the
  directory can be described by multiple objects. Attributes can have
  values which are text strings, dereferenceable file names, or text-
  encoded photographs, and experimentation is underway to keep digitally
  encoded sounds in the directory.

  The Coalition for Networked Information was founded in March 1990 to
  help realize the promise of high performance networks and computers
  for the advancement of scholarship and the enrichment of intellectual
  productivity.  The Coalition is a partnership of the Association of
  Research Libraries (ARL), CAUSE, and EDUCOM.  ARL is dedicated to
  equitable access to, and effective use of, recorded knowlege in
  support of teaching, research, scholarship, and community service, and
  CAUSE and EDUCOM are dedicated to different aspects of the
  introduction, use, and management of information technology and
  related resources in research and education in general and higher
  education in particular.  The Coalition pursues its mission with the
  assistance of a task force that provides a common vehicle by which
  nearly 178 institutions and organizations are exploring a shared
  vision of how information management must change in the 1990s to meet
  the social and economic opportunities and challenges of the 21st
  century.  Members of the Coalition Task Force include, among others,
  higher education institutions, publishers, network service providers,
  computer hardware, software, and systems companies, library netowrks
  and organizations, and public and state libraries, a truly diverse
  collaboration of institutions and organizations.

  distributed architecture of servers that draw upon a common or at
  least comparable set of data elements.  It plans to create a (printed
  and networked) directory of directories and resource information
  services that provides qualitative (consumer) as well as descriptive
  information.  The group supports the Library of Congress effort to
  enhance the MARC formats to account for the cataloging requirements of
  networked resources and services and the National Science Foundation
  effort to procure a new NSFNet Network Information Center.

 Description of main group:

 (from ARL Newsletter #164 -- September 9, 1992)

  The Coalition's TopNode Project is creating a directory of
  directories, catalogs, and aids of networked information resources,
  services, and tools.  The project is intended to facilitate the
  network navigational duties, responsibilities, and tasks of staff in
  libraries, computer centers, networking offices, and other similar
  operations.  The primary product of the TopNode project will be a set
  of records describing these networked information resources, records
  that can be loaded into a wide range of database management systems.

  Based on their response to a Call for Statements of Interest and
  Experience, Indiana University and Merit Network, Inc.  were chosen to
  lead the development effort on the Coalition TopNode project.  Pete
  Percival, Manager, Academic Information Environment at Indiana
  University and Craig Summerhill, Coalition Systems Coordinator, have
  completed the design for the database structure which is being built
  on the Coalition's Internet fileserver using BRS/SEARCH.  Based on
  earlier work of the leaders of the Directories and Resource
  Information Services Working Group, George Brett II of the University
  of North Carolina General Administration and Peggy Seiden of Skidmore
  College Library, Percival and Summerhill have developed a data
  structure that they believe to be both flexible and responsive to the
  needs of the many interested parties who have been consulted.

  Under the direction of Gary Charbonneau of the Indiana University
  Libraries, records are being created and prepared for loading.  A
  thesaurus of added descriptor terms is being maintained.  As of
  mid-August, close to 200 records had been verified and had received
  descriptive cataloging.

  When the database is complete, libraries will be alerted and
  encouraged to mount the TopNode records into their online catalogs.
  Records will be available from the Coalition.  In addition, MERIT will
  use the TopNode database in an experiment to test the viability of the
  X.500 directory format standard for providing yellow pages-type
  services (e.g.  with subject access).  After its initial release, the
  database will be maintained by Indiana University libraries on the
  Coalition server; BRS has assisted in the development of procedures
  for online data entry.

 Description of main group:

  Several user-friendly client-server software tools have been
  developed recently for locating and retrieving information
  published on computer platforms reachable over wide-area data
  communications networks like the Internet. Among them, the Wide
  Area Information Server (WAIS), the Internet Gopher, and archie
  have become popular, and the WorldWide Web (WWW) is poised for
  popularity once suitable client software is developed and
  distributed. WAIS, archie, and Gopher indicate where information
  of interest is likely to reside and then assist the user in
  locating specific information. WWW permits a user to thread a
  path through the network by selecting tagged hypertext items.
 
  While focused on the evolution of wide-area information systems,
  the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and
  Retrieval (CNIDR) will work closely with developers of other
  tools toward providing compatibility, consistency, and, to the
  extent possible, convergence of the tools.
 
  Specific activities will provide a central focus and forum for
  networked information discovery and retrieval (NIDR) tools and
  will minimize the divergence of individual implementations by
  providing a repository for the collection, evaluation, and
  distribution of protocol-compliant releases and enhanced
  versions.
 
  CNIDR participates in standards and policy associations such as
  the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Coalition for
  Networked Information, with the goal of increasing consensus
  among developers and exploring appropriate uses of networked
  information. CNIDR also actively promotes the use of networked
  information discovery and retrieval tools at many national and
  international conferences to inform and educate implementors and
  end users.

  was founded to facilitate the integration of various LANs running
  different protocols. It will develop, specify, and align protocols
  to integrate the services into a single "virtually unified information
  service" (VUIS).

  Also, where necessary for interoperability, IIIR will create technical
  documentation for protocols used for information services in the 
  internet.

 NIR Group Name: Networked Information Retrieval Working Group (NIR-WG)

 Sponsoring Organisation: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
                          RARE (Association of European Research Networks) 

 Working subgroups: 
  None
 
 Description of main group:

  This description below was extracted from the NIR-WG charter.

  There are many organizations and associations that have recently
  begun to focus on the proliferating resources and tools for
  networked information retrieval (NIR).  The Networked Information
  Retrieval Group will be a cooperative effort of three major
  players in the field of NIR: IETF, RARE, and the Coalition for
  Networked Information (CNI) specifically tasked to collect and
  disseminate information about the tools and to discuss and
  encourage cooperative development of current and future tools
  such such as the archie servers, the Wide Area Information
  Servers (WAIS), the Internet Gopher, and the WorldWide Web (WWW).

  The NIR Working Group intends to increase the useful base of
  information about networked information retrieval (NIR) tools,
  their developers, interested organizations, and other activities
  that relate to the production, dissemination, and support of NIR
  tools, to produce documentation that will enable user services
  organizations to provide better support for NIRtools, to develop
  materials that will assist the support and training of end users
  and to evolve in the future as necessary to meet and anticipate
  changes in the field (i.e., NIR tools, protocols, network
  topology, etc.)

 Membership is open and is not limited to attendees of the quarterly
 IETF meetings; the mailing list is open to all.  The NIR-WG charter
 can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the Document Archive sites
 listed below.

 NIR Group Name: Uniform Resource Identifiers (uri)

 Sponsoring Organisation: Internet Engineering Task Forces (IETF)

 Working subgroups: NONE

 Description of main group:

   The Uniform Resource Identifiers Archives Working Group is chartered to
   define a set of standards for the encoding of system independent
   Resource Location and Identification information for the use of
   Internet information services. There are three classes of information
   being standardized in this group:
     
     1)  Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which specify a standardized
         method for encoding location and access information to resources
         across multiple information systems,

     2)  Uniform Resource Names (URNs), which specify a standardized method
         for encoding a unique resource identifier for a given content, and

     3)  Uniform Resource Citations (URCs), which specify a standardized
         method for encoding information about a given instantiation of
         a content.

  The URLs allow an information service to give a user access and location
  information for a resource. The URN allows an information service to
  determine if the contents of two information resources are the same or
  not. The URC allows an information service to select which of a number
  of different encodings of a resource are appropriate for a given user's
  retrieval capabilities, and may contain such things as file size and
  compression techniques.

  Membership is open, and is not limited to IETF attendees. A full charter 
  for this group is available for anonymous FTP from nic.ddn.mil as

 NIR Group Name: Whois and Network Information Lookup Service (WNILS)

 Sponsoring Organisation: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

  Name of subgroup:
  Mailinglist-Address:

 Description of main group:


  This description is the current WNILS-WG charter.

  The Network Information Center (NIC) maintains the central NICNAME
  database and server, defined in RFC 954, providing online look-up of
  individuals, network organizations, key nodes, and other information
  of interest to those who use the Internet.  Other distributed
  directory information servers and information retrieval tools have
  been developed and it is anticipated more will be created.  Many sites
  now maintain local directory servers with information about
  individuals, departments and services at that specific site.
  Typically these directory servers are network accessible.  Because
  these servers are local, there are now wide variations in the type of
  data stored, access methods, search schemes, and user interfaces.  The
  purpose of the Whois and Network Information Lookup Service (WNILS)
  working group is to expand and define the standard for WHOIS services,
  to resolve issues associated with the variations in access and to
  promote a consistent and predictable service across the network.

 Goals and Milestones:

 Working Group or Organisation:  OCLC/USMARC
 Name of group: OCLC/USMARC Internet Resources Cataloging Experiment

 Sponsoring Organisation: OCLC, Library of Congress

 Working subgroups:  
   None

 Description of main group:

  OCLC and the Library of Congress have formed a working group to
  consider how libraries can create cataloging records for online
  information resources.  The group initiated a cataloging experiment
  designed to test and verify the applicability of the cataloging rules
  and the USMARC format for computer files.  Guidelines have been
  written for cataloging Internet resources and are being considered by
  the American Library Association committee responsible for maintaining
  the Anglo- American Cataloging Rules.  Changes to the USMARC format
  were initiated to accommodate a subset of these materials (electronic
  data resources, such as software, electronic text, bibliographic and
  nonbibliographic databases).  USMARC format changes which were
  approved included an identification of type of file and a field for
  location and access of the resource.  The group intends to continue
  its work by looking at how online systems and services can be
  accommodated in USMARC and initiate appropriate proposals.  Membership
  is closed at this point.

 RARE Groups
 
  RARE (Reseaux Associes pour la Recherche Europeenne) is the
  Association of European Networking Organizations and their users.
  RARE's aim is to overcome national boundaries in research networking
  by creating a harmonized computer communications infrastructure for
  the European research community.  At this point in time RARE has 41
  members, most of which are national networking organizations providing
  networking services to their national research and education
  community.

  RARE's technical programme is carried out by volunteers working in a
  number of Working Groups.

  Name of subgroup:    NIR Task Force
  Mailinglist-Address: nir@mailbase.ac.uk

  Name of subgroup:    UNITE Task Force
  Mailinglist-Address: unite@mailbase.ac.uk

 Description of main group:

  The Information Services and User Support (ISUS) Working Group
  has been established by the RARE Technical Committee as one of
  the major working groups in the RARE Technical Programme.  ISUS
  is concerned with all aspects of networked information services,
  group communications and network user support.  It is open to all
  those involved in working in these areas and should include:
 
 Network User Support Staff: National and European Support Staff
                             (whether RARE, RIPE, EARN, Eunet etc)
                             Site Computing Centre Support Staff
                             Special subject related User Support Staff
 
 Library Staff
 Networked Information Providers
 Networked Information Service Providers
 Application Developers
 
 The ISUS WG mailing list will act both as a forum for discussion
 amongst experts in this field and as a means for disseminating
 information to the wider community.
 
 The ISUS Working Group has a very broad remit which is broken
 down into several sub-areas:
               Network User Support
               Asynchronous Group Communication
               Networked Information Retrieval and Services
               Liaison
 
 Current tasks being worked on in the are of NIR include:
 
 o    Collection of "TopNode" Info for European Information
      Services

 o    Coordination of NIR services in Europe

 o    Collection of information related to NIR tools and groups.
      This is a joint effort with the IETF and CNI.

 o    Network Interface to everything (UNITE).  This group is starting
      to look at the user requirements for a single interface to the 
      network (network information services, email, bulletin boards,
      etc).  (unite@mailbase.ac.uk)

 o    ISUS WG/Interactive Multimedia WG joint task force on Multimedia
      Information Services is being set up.

 Description:            This mailing list was formed after a BOF session at
                         the San Diego IETF meeting in March, 1992.  It is
                         intended to act as a clearing-house for discussions 
                         of Networked Information retrieval and the active
                         research projects in this field (eg WAIS, WWW, 
                         Gopher).  It has hosted discussions on Universal
                         Document Identifiers, Universal Resource Locators,
                         Unique Resource Serial Numbers, etc. there is
                         considerable overlap between this group and the
                         "ietf-udi" group (see below) and we expect them to
                         eventually merge.

 NIR Tool Name: Hyper-G

 Brief Description of Tool:

  Hyper-G is the name of an ambitious hypermedia project currently being
  developed as a joint effort by a number of institutes of the IIG
  (Institutes for Information-Processing Graz) and the Computing and
  Information Services Center of the Graz University of Technology and
  the Austrian Computer Society.

  Hyper-G is designed as a general-purpose, large-scale, multi-user,
  distributed hypermedia information system.  As such, it combines
  concepts of hypermedia, information retrieval systems, documentation
  systems with aspects of communication and collaboration, and computer
  supported teaching and learning.  It also provides seamless
  integration of other systems (e.g. World-Wide Web, Gopher, WAIS) that
  also operate under the client/server paradigm and allows remote logins
  to interactive services.

  In addition to hypertext links, Hyper-G allows navigation through hierarchies,
  queries (includeing full text), and guided tours.

  Hyper-G is currently operated as a University Information System at
  the Graz Technical University.  THE SOFTWARE IS STILL VERY MUCH
  EXPERIMENTAL!  Client binaries are available for UNIX workstations
  from DEC, HP, SGI, and SUN.

 NRT

     Email address: sanderso@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 NIR Tool Name: NRT

 Brief Description of Tool:

  NRT stands for News Retrieval Tool.  It is a probabilistic free text
  information retrieval system.  The system is built using a 'client
  server approach', the client is a user interface which sends retrieval
  commands to the server.

  The user retrieves documents by presenting NRT with a query.  The
  query can consist of fragments of text or whole documents.  When
  presented with a query NRT assigns a 'relevance score' to each
  document in the collection.  The score is an indication of the
  relevance between a document and the query.  Documents are sorted by
  their score with the highest scoring documents being presented to the
  user.  If the query consists of whole documents, NRT analyses the
  document texts, picking out words from the texts and adding them to
  the user's query.

  NIR Tool Name:    SoftPages
 
  Brief Description of Tool:
 
   A tool to aid users in the efficient retrieval of documents,
   s/w, and the like from servers ( anonymous FTP, FTAM, .. )
   connected to the network.
   In principle, it uses the X.500 Directory framework to store
   information about the network. This includes the network 
   configuration, the properties of the links that connect the
   network elements, location of servers and their
   contents. When a user looks for a particular document or s/w
   the above information is used to search for the object starting
   from the server that is "nearest"(cheapest) to the user.
                         
   - user's view
                 
   A "single window" view of the public archives connected to
   the network. It locates the server that contains the sought 
   object and is near(/cheap/fast) server. 
 
   Query of files based on incomplete name is supported. The 
   system also supports queries based on keywords.
 
   - information provider's view
                 
   The information about the server contents have to be updated 
   at a single place- namely, the local Directory Service Agent. 
   The Directory Service Agent makes the information globally 
   accessible.
   It is not necessary to carry out periodic updates on one or
   more information servers. 
 
   - information types supported (e.g. text, sound, etc)
 
   Since the system supports query on name and keywords (not on
   contents) all kinds of information may be supported.

 WHOIS++

 Date template updated or checked: 20th March, 1993

 NIR Tool Name: whois++ and the whois++ index service

 Brief Description of Tool:

  whois++ and the whois++ index service are extensions of the WHOIS 
  protocol. They are designed to a) subsume in a standardized fashion the
  many enhancements which have been added to individual WHOIS servers;
  b) extend the flexibility of WHOIS by enriching the query syntax, and
  c) provide a distributed indexing system to tie the various whois++ servers
  into a distributed information lookup service.

  The protocols describe two logically distinct types of servers that an
  information provider can set up. The first type is the base-level
  whois++ server. This contains primary information, such as entries for
  individual people or entries describing resources available locally.
  For example, if one wished to provide a campus directory through whois++,
  one would set up a base-level whois++ server that contained entries for
  each student. In addition, this base-level server must be able to generate
  'forward knowledge' for the information it contains. The second type of
  server collects the 'forward knowledge' generated by a number of base-level
  servers, and can take a query sent to it and determine which of the
  base-level servers it indexes might contain information relevant for the
  query. A single physical server may contain both primary information and
  'forward knowledge' for a number of other servers, and an index server can
  also index 'forward knowledge' for a number of other index servers, allowing
  a hierarchical mesh of index servers to be built. For more details on the
  information provider's point of view, see the 'Documentation' section
  of this template.

  The basic information model is centered on the concept of 'templates'.
  A template is a collection of attribute:value pairs, where the allowable
  attributes are specified by the template type. The whois++ templates
  are based on the templates defined by the IAFA working group of the IETF.
  The values associated with given attributes are not necessarily limited
  to text, they can be digitized sound clips, etc. 

  Depending on the client she uses, the user will see a connection to the
  local whois++ base-level server. The user can ask the server for a list
  of templates supported by that server, and can then call up a blank 
  version of the template so that she can fill in values for the attributes
  she knows. Once she has filled in the template as much as she wants, she
  issues a query to the server to find all the entries which have these 
  attribute:value pairs. If she is not satisfied with the responses, she
  can then start traversing the index service to locate a server which
  can adequately answer her query. In addition, if a user makes frequent 
  use of the index service, she can set 'bookmarks' which can be
  used later to directly contact servers she's found useful in the past,
  without having to traverse the index service again.

 Other Information:

   As this is a coming attraction, we encourage people to get in on the
   ground floor. The authors of this protocol see it as potentially 
   being a key player in any integrated Internet information architecture,
   and we can always use more volunteers who want to beta-test code for
   us.
