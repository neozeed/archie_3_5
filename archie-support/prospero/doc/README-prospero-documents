This file (README-prospero-documents, version of 30 November 1993,
swa@isi.edu) describes the publicly available documents about the
Prospero Directory Service.  For comments on this file or questions
about prospero, please send electronic mail to info-prospero@ISI.EDU

These files are all available through Prospero.  If you're not running
Prospero yet, they're also available via anonymous FTP from
PROSPERO.ISI.EDU.

Some of the documents mentioned below this point in this file are
marked with the label DISTRIBUTION and are additionally available in
the doc subdirectory of the latest Beta and Alpha Prospero releases
(releases Beta.5.1 and Alpha.5.2a).  A good way to obtain the Prospero
distribution, if you're not running Prospero yet, is to anonymously
FTP to PROSPERO.ISI.EDU and get /pub/prospero/prospero.tar.Z.  If you
are already running Prospero, the lastest distribution is kept in
/releases/prospero/prospero.tar.Z.

This is a useful first paper to read.  It gives a good overview of
Prospero and what it does.  It also describes a bit about the Virtual
System model, of which Prospero is a prototype implementation.  It
describes what Prospero does, not how it does it.

This is an audio transcript of an November 17, 1993 interview on the
Internet Talk Radio "Geek of the Week" program.  The description:

       Carl Malamud interviews Clifford Neuman, instrumental in the
  development of Internet protocols such as Kerberos and Prospero.
  Neuman discusses what Prospero is and how this miracle system can
  be anything you want it to be.  Neuman also discusses his work
  in security and how that relates to his recent interests in resource
  discovery.


It is 30 minutes long and is a good thing to listen to for the
philosophy behind the Prospero virtual system model.

overview of how Prospero does what it does.

This paper describes how Prospero can be used to integrate internet
information services, including Gopher, WAIS, Archie, and World Wide
Web.  It is another good first paper to read about Prospero.  The paper will 
be presented at INET'93 in August.

This is a good second paper to read about Prospero.  This one is
targeted more toward system implementors.  It provides more
implementation details than the paper on organizing Internet
resources, but less of the vision of how Prospero can be used together
with other systems.  Note: the online copy is the paper presented at
the Workshop on File System.  A slightly revised version of the paper
which subsequently appeared in Computing Systems and Computing Systems is
the preferred citation.

This paper describes how the Prospero Directory Service can be used to
solve the server selection problem and the user location problem.  The
paper was presented in August, 1993, at the Usenix Symposium on Mobile
and Location-Independent Computing.

This describes the initial vision for the Virtual System Model, the
model on which Prospero is based.  Much of the material in this paper
appears in greater detail in other papers.

information in this document appears in more recent papers and the
dissertation itself.

This paper describes the reasons that operating systems need to
support closure, that is they need to make it clear which name space
is to be used when resolving names.  While closure is one of the
important features of Prospero, the concept should be applied in other
operating systems too.

This is Clifford Neuman's Ph.D. Dissertation.  It is currently the
definitive work on Prospero and the Virtual System Model.  The
prospero manuals that form its appendices have been superseded by
those described below.

DISTRIBUTION: protocol.PS, protocol.tex
(POSTSCRIPT or LaTeX)
        This is a description of version 5 of the Prospero protocol
and of the Reliable Delivery Protocol that we use.  It includes lots
of information that was elided in the version 1 protocol
specification.  It also has a lot of information in it about how the
system works.  The LaTeX source is available as
prospero-protocol-v5.tex.Z.

Prospero: /papers/subjects/computers/operating-systems/prospero/doc/prospero-protocol-v1.PS.Z
Anonymous FTP: /pub/prospero/doc/prospero-protocol-v1.PS.Z
(POSTSCRIPT)
        This is a description of version 1 of the Prospero protocol.
(It's identical to appendices D and E of B. Clifford Neuman's Ph.D.
Dissertation.)  It is now obsoleted by version 5 protocol.  However,
we are still making it available since a number of older servers are running
version 1 protocol, and since most of the current ARCHIE clients use the
older Version 1 protocol.

	This is the Prospero User's manual.  It is slightly out of

        Prospero library manual.  Somewhat sketchy and not
comprehensive, but far better than nothing.  This is mainly useful for
applications writers.  This is slowly being updated.  Latex source in
the corresponding .tex file.

This is not really Prospero-specific, but it addresses general issues
of scale in distributed systems.  It discusses Prospero among other
systems, and mentions a number of the issues that are driving the
development of Prospero.
