First, please note that the documentation files in this directory do not 
fully reflect Prospero version 5.  Due to the demand for Prospero
version 5, we have decided to ship this Alpha release before we fully
update the documentation.

getting-started.txt:  How to get started using prospero.  

ARCHIE.README: Description of how to compile the ARCHIE client and how
to use ARCHIE through Prospero.

man/archie.man:  Manual page for the Archie client we provide.

.virt-sys:  A .virt-sys file you can put in your home directory to use
the guest virtual system at PROSPERO.ISI.EDU

customize.insts:  Instructions for customizing your virtual system.

manual.tex, manual.PS:  The Prospero user's manual.  This hasn't been
updated much since version 4.

library.tex, library.PS: Prospero library manual.  This documents some
of the calls to the Prospero PFS and PCOMPAT libraries.  It's out of
date and sketchy. 

protocol.tex, protocol.PS: Describes version 5 of the Prospero
protocol.  This is almost completely up to date.

We provide the LaTeX source for the three manuals, as well as
Postscript output files that you can just dump on your laser printer. 

The following files are auxiliary LaTeX files you'll need if you're
running LaTeX.  They're included or otherwise used by the .tex files:

           rkrcite.sty, fullpage.sty

README-prospero-documents: contains a bibliography of prospero documents.

The subdirectory 'working-notes' contains some working notes on
concepts we firmed up while developing the menu browser.  These will
eventually make their way into more formal reference documents;
however, we felt it would be better to release them now in this state
rather than hoard them until they are in final form.
