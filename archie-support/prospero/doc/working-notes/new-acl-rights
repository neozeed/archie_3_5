The more common entry appears first if multiple rights allow an
operation.  The operation identifier appears second.

  >)     >)       >)        >]     Add rights (that follow the symbol)
  <(     <(       <(        <[     Remove rights (that follow the symbol)

Note that there used to be a B right, which you should consider as
equivalent to A, but you should avoid using it.

The following only appear on the server maintenance ACL

  S       Restart server
  T       Terminate server
  U       Update system information
  P       Administer passwords
  p P     Add new password entry

A "-" sign in an ACL entry means that the specified rights are
explicitly denied.  

* A small letter on a directory ACL means that this right applies by
  default for links in the directory that do not specify their own
  ACL or that include the directory ACL.  A capital letter on a link
  ACL is ignored.

** When restrictions are supported, they can be used to restrict the
   specific attributes to which a right applies, or to restrict the
   interpretation of an ACL entry to only the Object, File, or Directory,
   or link. 

Note that OBJECT, FILE, and DIRECTORY ACLs are stored in the same
place, and share the same access control list (well, directory is
different for now, but will eventually be merged).
