Subject: About UDP ports that archie uses
Status: R

There are two ports officially assigned to Prospero (and hence archie
as well).  The official port is 191, and the official non-privileged
port is 1525.  If a Prospero or archie server is able to bind the
privileged port, the server will listen on both ports.  If not, it
will only listen on the non-privileged port.

If the server can bind the privileged port, the response will be sent
on the privileged port.  The default port used to contact a server is
presently 1525, which is the most general port since all servers
listen on it.  It is not uncommon to have a message sent on 1525, but
to receive the response from 191.  If you are writing your own client,
it should not reject a response simply because the server port
changed.  You may use the connection id in the response to pair the
response with the request.
