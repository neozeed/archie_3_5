This file describes some of the design decisions that were made during
the multi-threading of the Prospero server, and the rationales for the
decisions.

We decided to use the Posix threads library {pthreads) because:
a) it was already becoming a standard; nothing else was.
b) it had the needed functionality for our simple task
c) a free implementation existed for our development environment, SunOS 4.1.3 
   on the SPARC processor.
