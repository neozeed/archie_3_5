Supported: This release has been tested on:

 Sun3s and Sun4s running SunOS version 4.1.1 -- No known problems

 HP 9000 series 700 workstations running HPUX version 8.0.5
        -- Clients and server have been tested
        -- Known Problem: the directory reading parts of the
           compatability library do not work yet.  You should not
           install it on such machines.

 MIPS little-endian processor running Ultrix Version 4.2A -- No known problems

 We have received patches for the server for the IBM RS6000 under AIX
 and merged them in, but do not have access to one of these machines
 in order to test them ourselves.  The compatability library will not
 compile under AIX.

 Although SOLARIS is defined in the file include/pmachine.h as a 
 supported option, , we have not completed merging in the Solaris changes we 
 were sent.  Those will be in a patchlevel coming in a few days.
 

Known Compilation Warnings:

 * Under some versions of ULTRIX, spurious compilation warnings are
   generated about NULL being redefined.  If you get these messages,
   you can add the flag  
	-DCONFLICT_BETWEEN_DEFINITION_OF_NULL_IN_SYS_PARAM_H_AND_STDDEF_H
   to the definition of MACHDEF in the top-level Makefile.  This will
   eliminate most (although not all) of the warnings.  These warnings
   can be safely disregarded.
